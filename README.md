# Description
You'll use GraphQL with Apollo to run queries and mutations to fetch and modify data to replace the existing RESTful API that was built with the Apollo Server. To complete the build you'll be using a full MERN stack with a react front end, MongoDB database, Node.js/Express.js server and API.

# User Story 
+ AS AN avid reader
+ I WANT to search for new books to read
+ SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase

# Installation
* to run this application clone it to your local machine
* * if you have a newer version of Node.js you will need to run the following line of code `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` to make sure that the dependencies are correctly installed to run the program
* in the root folder run `npm i` to install all the dependencies required to run the application
* once all dependencies have been successfully installed run `npm start` from the root folder to start the application

# Usage
Via a Google owned API, a user while logged into their account can save books to their profile and review them at a later time. The books each have their own profile and information paired with the book title so it's an online library.
